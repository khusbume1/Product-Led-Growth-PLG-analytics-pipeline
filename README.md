# Product-Led-Growth-PLG-analytics-pipeline
This project demonstrates a **Product-Led Growth (PLG) analytics pipeline** built with an open-source Kaggle dataset.   I engineered custom metrics, performed funnel and retention analysis, and created a dashboard-ready set of visualizations to simulate a real-world data analytics workflow at a PLG-focused company.
